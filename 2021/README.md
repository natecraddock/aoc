These puzzles are solved using the Zig compiler v0.8.1.

The solutions contain the exact logic used to solve the puzzle, but I may have
cleaned up the code for readability before committing. If I later found a more
interesting way to find the solution that solution is included and noted as a
later attempt.

See the `src/util.zig` file for shared utility functions. I wrote these as I
went along, so earlier solutions do not make use of many of the functions.

Thanks to [SpexGuy](https://github.com/SpexGuy/Zig-AoC-Template) for the
starting template.
